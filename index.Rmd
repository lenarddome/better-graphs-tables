# Better Graphs: Session

<br><br><br><br>

> Modern data graphics can do much more than simply substitute for small statistical
> tables. At their best, graphics are instruments for reasoning about quantitative
> information. Often most effective way to describe, explore, and summarise a set of
> numbers - even a very large set - is to look at pictures of those numbers<sup>[1]</sup>
