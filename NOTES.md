## Better Tables Session

Tables created with R are reproducible.
You can create the table from the bottom up straight from your data.
The advantage of this is that there is no hand editing, because the process is automated.
This means that if you need to format your table, you do not need to edit the values and lines by hand, but only use the appropriate command from the appropriate package to produce a table with a brand new design.
If you use R, you only need to change a few lines of command.
If you edit by hand, you can end up spending an hour to editing the table.
That time (in my opinion) should be spent on more important matters.
Because R tables are reproducible, you can reuse R scripts you wrote.
This lets you use previous R scripts to make tables in any future projects by effortlessly inserting a few lines of R commands from the script.

Another big advantage is that it supports all formats.
Some places require you to submit figures and tables separately in PDF, some asks you to put it at the end of the document as a word document.
All this is made easier with R.

This worksheet is all about making your life easier - I know it might not seem like that now, but rest assured it will come to fruition when you are doing your data analysis or making a presentation in your future job.

I would only give you a couple of suggestions for the worksheet. 

1. Read everything. All the explanations are their for you - not only now but also in the future. If you read the worksheet once, you will be able to find things in the future if you need them.
2. Try to solve errors by yourselves. Try to explore what you can do and what R can do. You can google how to make tables in R and you end up with a myriad of packages.
3. Feedback is always appreciated. Do let me know if you think some things should be clearer; if you think something is missing from the worksheet.
