# Teacher's Notes

This session, and its complementary session, will help you learn how to create tables and graphs from the bottom up.
Both tables and figures are essentially ways to help communicate some information.
You need to think of them as literary devices that  drive the plot.
They are tools to clarify parts of your message and help you get your points across.
This is important!
They summarise and clarify.
You can see that sometimes tables and graphs are used to repeat information instead of making it clearer.
They repeat information in an attempt to solidify the message.
This is the wrong the strategy, because it will not help to make your message clearer or to deliver it, but instead tries to hammer the message into the reader.
In this workshop, you will complete a worksheet that walks you through each steps of creating a table, demonstrates some good practices, and provides some good suggestions.

## Better Tables Session

Tables created with R are reproducible.
You can create the table from the bottom up straight from your data.
The advantage of this is that there is no hand editing, because the process is automated.
This means that if you need to format your table, you do not need to edit the values and lines by hand, but only use the appropriate command from the appropriate package to produce a table with a brand new design.
If you use R, you only need to change a few lines of command.
If you edit by hand, you can end up spending an hour to editing the table.
That time (in my opinion) should be spent on more important matters.
Because R tables are reproducible, you can reuse R scripts you wrote.
This lets you use previous R scripts to make tables in any future projects by effortlessly inserting a few lines of R commands from the script.
This is fairly useful when you have to create for example monthly presentation for your employer or produce the same table across different data sets from different projects.
Another big advantage is that it supports all formats.
Some places require you to submit figures and tables separately in PDF, some asks you to put it at the end of the document as a word document.
R will also allow you to create tables for blog posts or interactive tables you can play around online or during a presentation.
All this is made easier with R.

This worksheet is all about making your life easier - I know it might not seem like that now, but rest assured it will come to fruition when you are doing your data analysis or making a presentation in your future job.

I would only give you a couple of suggestions for the worksheet.

1. Read everything. All the explanations are their for you - not only now but also in the future. If you read the worksheet once, you will be able to find things in the future if you need them.
2. Try to solve errors by yourselves. Try to explore what you can do and what R can do. You can google how to make tables in R and you end up with a myriad of packages.
3. Feedback is always appreciated. Do let me know if you think some things should be clearer; if you think something is missing from the worksheet.

## Better Tables Assessment

PSYC:EL assesments:

1. two component, both are in-class exercises
2. include all the code from loading the packages and the data until the point the graph is produced

## Better Graphs Session

Data visualization is essentially a data compression technique.
You sculpt, squeeze, hammer your data into a shape that can be understood by a human being.
Figures are not just replacement for tables.
At their best, figures are tools of argumentation.
They are part of your reasoning.
This worksheet is there to give you the practical background that you need to reason with data.

In this worksheet we will use R.
R is great for data visualisation for a multitude of reasons.
R figures are reproducible.
You can use the same R scripts for different projects, different presentation.
You can effortlessly copy and paste old R code to create a new graph with the same design that you used in a previous report or presentation.
This is especially important, because I think time spent on formatting figures to adhere to guidelines is better spent on other creative work.
The idea here is that the code you wrote in R can be reused for all kinds of things.
Whereas, a figure in excel cannot be copied into a new excel sheet to create the graph with the same deign.

Another advantage of R is that it is incredibly powerful at creating high-quality figures.
When I say high-quality, I really mean high-resolution publication-ready images that contain the figure.
R is also cross-compatible with every possible format you will need (can do word document, image, pdf).

One of the biggest advantage it has is that it is great for exploring data.
You can save intermediate stages of your figure, so you can try out different things without overwriting different styles you tried.
You can create half the graph, set the values on each axis, and try out all the different type of plots, bar charts and so on, without losing what you have already done.
This is something that you should employ in your own data analysis.
The worksheet gives you quite a few practical tips and guidelines on how to go about it.

As I said before, this worksheet is here to make your life easier. 
It might not seem like it at the beginning, but it will save you a lot of headaches in the future.
I would only give you a couple of suggestions for the worksheet.

1. Read everything. All the explanations are their for you - not only now but also in the future. If you read the worksheet once, you will be able to find things in the future if you need them.
2. Try to solve errors by yourselves. Try to explore what you can do and what R can do. You can google how to make tables in R and you end up with a myriad of packages.
3. Feedback is always appreciated. Do let me know if you think some things should be clearer; if you think something is missing from the worksheet.

## Better Graphs Assessment

The PSYC:EL task is a PASS/FAIL element of this skills package.
Make sure that you upload the correct PDF file.
I think everything else is pretty straightforward.
